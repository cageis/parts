## Adding New Comment Styles

To add support for a new comment style:

1. **Add to comments.go:**
   ```go
   // Add to commentStyles map
   "newstyle": {Start: "//", End: ""},
   
   // Add file extensions to extensionToStyle map
   ".newext": "newstyle",
   ```

2. **Add tests:**
   ```go
   // Add test case to commentStyles_test.go
   {"New style", "newstyle", "// PARTIALS>>>>>", "// PARTIALS<<<<<"},
   ```

3. **Update documentation:**
   - Add examples to README.md
   - Update help text if needed
   - Add example in examples/ directory

4. **Test thoroughly:**
   ```bash
   bin/parts --dry-run test.newext ./partials "newstyle"
   bin/parts --dry-run test.newext ./partials "auto"
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Test all public functions
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Mock external dependencies when needed
- Test error conditions

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows
- Test with real files
- Test different comment styles
- Test both build and remove operations

### Example Tests
- All examples must work
- Examples are tested in CI
- Add new examples for new features

## Documentation Guidelines

### README Updates
- Keep examples current
- Update feature lists
- Maintain installation instructions
- Update usage patterns

### Code Documentation
- Document all exported functions
- Explain complex logic
- Provide usage examples in comments
- Keep documentation up to date
