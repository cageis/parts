# Parts Development Roadmap

This document tracks planned improvements and features for the Parts project. Items are organized by priority and category to help guide development efforts.

## Recently Completed âœ…

- [x] Add proper error handling instead of `panic()` calls
- [x] Add command-line argument validation and help text
- [x] Create idempotent editing tests to prevent whitespace growth
- [x] Implement comprehensive Makefile with development tools
- [x] Add project documentation (README, ROADMAP)
- [x] Migrate to standard Go testing framework (`testing` package)
- [x] Add dry-run mode (`--dry-run` flag) to preview changes
- [x] Create proper CLI interface with flags library (cobra/flag)
- [x] Support multiple comment character styles (e.g., `//`, `/*`, `--`)
- [x] Enhanced comment markers with proper header/footer blocks for visual clarity
- [x] Add `--remove` flag to cleanly remove partials sections from files
- [x] Refactor large monolithic file into focused modules with clear separation of concerns

## High Priority ðŸ”¥

### Code Quality & Structure
- [ ] Implement structured logging with levels (info, warn, error)
- [ ] Add configuration file support (YAML/TOML)
- [ ] Implement graceful error messages for common failures

### Essential Features
- [ ] Add backup functionality (create `.bak` files before modification)

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Add benchmarks for performance testing
- [ ] Create integration tests with real SSH config scenarios

## Medium Priority ðŸ“‹

### Features & Functionality  
- [ ] Implement watch mode to auto-rebuild on partial file changes
- [ ] Add support for nested partial directories
- [ ] Create template system for generating boilerplate partials
- [ ] Add merge conflict detection and resolution

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add fuzzing tests for edge cases
- [ ] Implement code coverage reporting
- [ ] Add property-based testing for idempotency verification
- [ ] Create test fixtures for various file formats

### Documentation & Usability
- [ ] Add man page generation
- [ ] Create usage examples for different file types (not just SSH)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide with common issues
- [ ] Document security considerations
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add changelog and versioning
- [ ] Include performance benchmarks in README

## Low Priority ðŸ“…

### Distribution & Packaging
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create release automation with goreleaser
- [ ] Package for major distributions (Homebrew, APT, RPM)
- [ ] Create Docker container for isolated usage
- [ ] Add shell completion scripts (bash, zsh, fish)
- [ ] Generate checksums for releases

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Optimize for large files (streaming processing)
- [ ] Add concurrent processing for multiple files
- [ ] Implement caching for unchanged partials
- [ ] Add memory usage profiling and optimization
- [ ] Support for very large directory structures
- [ ] Add file locking for concurrent access safety

### Security & Reliability
- [ ] Add file permission preservation
- [ ] Implement atomic file operations
- [ ] Add input sanitization and validation  
- [ ] Create security audit checklist
- [ ] Add support for running as non-root user
- [ ] Implement rollback functionality on failure
- [ ] Add file integrity checking (checksums)

## Future/Advanced Features ðŸš€

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Add plugin system for custom processors
- [ ] Implement file format validation (SSH config syntax checking)
- [ ] Add support for encrypted partials
- [ ] Create web UI for managing partials
- [ ] Add integration with version control systems
- [ ] Support for remote partial sources (HTTP/S3)
- [ ] Add metrics and analytics collection (opt-in)

## Contributing

When working on items from this roadmap:

1. **Move items to "In Progress"** by adding your name/date
2. **Create issues** for larger features to discuss implementation
3. **Update this file** when items are completed
4. **Add new items** as they're identified during development

## Versioning Strategy

- **v0.x**: Current prototype phase, focus on core functionality
